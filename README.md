# Welcome to the CQRS on AWS Git Repository!

This is the Git repository that hosts the code of the different examples approached in the AWS Blog Posts series that show how to
implement the CQRS architectural pattern on AWS.

For each example described in each AWS Blog Post, you can run the corresponding code and have the related
infrastructure deployed in your AWS account, exactly as described in each blog post. Each infrastructure is implemented
as AWS CDK code in Python. AWS CDK is AWS' open source framework in which we can define infrastructure as code in our
favorite programming languages.
